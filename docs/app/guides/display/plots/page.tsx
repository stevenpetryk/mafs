      <p>
        Mafs supports numerically plotting a number of function types by passing in plain JavaScript
        functions.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Inequalities of <em className="font-display">x</em> and <em className="font-display">y</em>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Inequalities represent the region less than or greater than one or two functions. Mafs
        allows you to plot the region between two functions, or a function and a constant. The
        inequality can be a function of <em className="font-display">x</em> or{" "}
        <em className="font-display">y</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot provide an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code> prop to Inequality—it will throw a
        runtime exception. Similarly, you cannot pass conflicting inequality operators—like both{" "}
        <code>&lt;</code> <em>and</em> <code>≤</code>.

      <h2>Vector fields</h2>

      <p>
        Vector fields take a function that is passed a point <code>[x, y]</code> and returns a
        vector at that point. Vectors are then artificially scaled down (for legibility) and plotted
        on the coordinate plane. You must also pass a <code>step</code> to indicate how dense the
        vector field is.
      </p>

      <h2>Render quality</h2>

      <h3>Function sampling</h3>

      <p>
        <code>Plot.OfX</code>, <code>Plot.OfY</code>, and <code>Plot.Parametric</code> use numerical
        methods for evaluating a function and attempting to plot it accurately. The approach works
        well for most functions, but it's far from perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mafs samples functions by by recursively subdividing the domain until an estimated error
        threshold is met (or the recursion limit limit is reached).
      </p>

      <h4>Sampling depth</h4>

      <p>
        To force more subdivisions (and therefore improve quality), the{" "}
        <code>minSamplingDepth</code> and <code>maxSamplingDepth</code> props can be tuned.
        Increasing <code>minSamplingDepth</code> can help when you want to ensure more subdivisions
        and improve accuracy, and lowering <code>maxSamplingDepth</code> can help improve
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's an example of a common "stress test" function for plotters, sin(1/x). This function
        exhibits an infinite oscillation frequency as x approaches 0, requiring theoretically
        infinite sampling to render perfectly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The top plot has the default sampling depths, while the bottom has{" "}
        <code>minSamplingDepth</code> increased to <code>16</code>. More samples still doesn't
        render the function perfectly, but it's much closer (at the cost of performance: the bottom
        plot has nearly 3 megabytes of SVG path data).
      </p>

      <CodeAndExample example={SineStressTest} />

      <p>
        If you pan this example around, you may see a considerably slow framerate. Interestingly,
        this slowness is happening in the browser code itself, not in JavaScript (and therefore not
        in Mafs). It would seem that merely rendering large SVG paths is expensive.
      </p>

      <h3>Vector fields</h3>

      <p>
        Vector field rendering quality can be tuned with the <code>step</code> prop. This declares
        the spacing between arrows, so lowering it will decrease performance.
