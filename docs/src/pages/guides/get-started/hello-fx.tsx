    <p>
      Documentation often starts with &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;. For this library, the equivalent
      example is rendering a function on the coordinate plane and making it a little bit
      interactive.
    </p>

    <h2>Drawing a coordinate plane</h2>

    <p>
      Mafs only needs a few components to set up a working coordinate plane view. We'll start with
      the same setup we had in &ldquo;Installation&rdquo;—just a Cartesian coordinate plane with
      nothing too interesting on it.
    </p>

    <CodeAndExample component={<Plain />} source={PlainSource} />

    <p>
      <code>CartesianCoordinates</code> is pretty customizable. Let's make our graph a little bit
      more sophisticated-looking by adding some subdivisions.
    </p>

    <CodeAndExample component={<Subdivions />} source={SubdivionsSource} />

    <h2>Plotting a function</h2>

    <p>
      Plotting a function works by passing a literal JavaScript function. Let's plot{" "}
      <code>Math.sin(x)</code>.
    </p>

    <CodeAndExample component={<Sine />} source={SineSource} />

    <p>
      Nice! We've passed a plain old JavaScript function, and Mafs evaluated it at many points along
      our coordinate plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      This looks a little weird though: sine waves are periodic in π, so it'd be nice to reflect
      that in our coordinate plane. Let's do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tell the x-axis to draw a line at every multiple of π</li>
      <li>Label the x-axis in terms of π</li>
      <li>Zoom the x-axis out a bit</li>
      <li>Zoom the y-axis in a bit</li>
    </ul>

    <CodeAndExample component={<SinePi />} source={SinePiSource} />

    <p>
      At this point, it's worth noting that you haven't <em>instructed</em> the library to do
      anything—you've just declared what you want on the screen. This model of programming is core
      to React, and also core to this library.
    </p>

    <h2>Making things interactive</h2>

    <p>
      If you imagine holding what you've just build in your hands, it would feel only natural to
      slide the wave back and forth to adjust the phase. Let's add a movable point and hook it up to
      our function.
    </p>

    <CodeAndExample component={<Draggable />} source={DraggableSource} />

    <p>
      There are a few noteworthy things here: one is how we declared our point. We start centered on
      the origin, but constrain the motion of the point horizontally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also worth noting is how we subtracted <code>phase.x</code> from the <code>x</code> in our
      sine function. This is just math—we're moving our wave side-to-side based on the point's
      position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, we draw <code>{"{phase.element}"}</code> on the view, which renders the actual point.
      We place it last so that it gets rendered above our function.
    </p>

    <h2>Up next</h2>

    <p>
      The remainder of these guides are more specific: they cover components you can add to your
      visualization. The rest is up to you and your imagination. The examples on this site might
      provide some inspiration, though.
