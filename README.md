# Mafs

Mafs is a set of opinionated React components for creating math visualizations.

## Development

It's simplest to iterate on Mafs from the documentation site, where things are
set up such that you can embed and live-update examples. The docs site is
powered by Gatsby, and directly imports files from the Mafs `src/` folder
(rather than using the genuine `mafs` NPM package).

To start the docs site (which will also compile Mafs), run the following:

```
cd docs
yarn start
```

## Tests

This library has no tests, but they're planned.
